        "You did an outstanding job this sprint. Now you know SQL databases, how to make basic data operations. You are familiar with the pros and cons of SQL and should know when to choose a NoSQL database. Data scraping is a technique that you can use to create your own dataset. You are also familiar with the basic concepts of Spark. You should be proud of yourself! For the last lesson of this week, you should put all your learnings into one place to collect, process, and store data. Combining these two might require a bit of planning at first but this is what you will need to do now."
